## Frontend - TypeScript/JavaScript
I am curretly working a lot with Typescript and Javascript. I work on projects using Angular, React, Vue, and Svelte. They are all pretty awesome and I'm not sure what I like best. Within this I work with a ton of great libraries and tools including, WebPack, Vite, RxJs, Apollo, React-Query, and more. 

## Node - Server Side
On the server-side I work a lot in Node, of course. I use Serverless, Netlify, AWS, Nginx, and Docker on a daily basis.

## Database
I used MySQL, SQlite, PostgresQL early on in my adventures, but have since seen more advantages and a more enjoyable experiences with NoSQL, and specifically FaunaDB, DynamoDB (Elastic Search), and MongoDB.

## Python, PHP, C & Golang
Some things I have less experience in are Python, PHP, C, and Golang, although I have worked with all of these and some great tools for using these languages on the web. Flask and Laravel to be specific. In Python I have also been going through the CS50 AI course, and loving playing with the incredible things computers can do.
