I am a full time software engineer from Long Beach, Calif. Currently working remotely in California. 

I work at [**Model Match**](https://modelmatch.com) where I help create and maintain software that quickly brings huge amounts of data to people in an easy, intuitive, and digestable way. [**Model Match**](https://modelmatch.com) is a CRM for recruiters in the morgage industry :house:. 

I work with Angular <AngularIcon />, and have built in, or reworked, a ton of great features inside our CRM; an imporoved tool for looking through contact tables and finding and the right people, a text messaging and phone call tool for easily working with contacts while travel throughout the app, and more :tada:. I also work with Elastic Search <ElasticSearchLogo /> and have helped to optimize a lot of our tools for searching, filtering, sorting, indexing, and more.

I'm really passionate about making things run _faster_ and improving workflow for myself and my team ‚ö°Ô∏è. I love problem solving and working with other to find optimal solutions. I'm lucky I get to do that every day. üòâ

I am also currently a Web Developement Teaching Asssitant at [UC Irivne, Division of Continuing Education](https://uci.edu). Zot, zot üíôüíõ. This program, along with others, helped me to become a better developer and a better person. I'm really excited to pay it forward :pray:.

In addition to work, I am working on a ton of cool stuff with [**Bavel**](https://github.com/BAVEL-Technology), a group of collegues trying to dream up new tools that help other developers and the community as a whole.

I also love working on personal, fun, and open source projects. You check out all my stuff [here](/projects).

Outside of programming I love surfing, food, [wine](https://vin.nickgraffis.me), coffee, [water polo](/about/waterpolo), family, friends, and of course, Wesley :dog:. Thanks for reading!
