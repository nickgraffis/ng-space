I am a full time software engineer from Long Beach, Calif. Currently working remotely in California. Check out my :pancakes: [tech stack](/techstack), and all the awesome stuff I like to [use](/uses) in tech.

I work at [**Model Match**](https://modelmatch.com) where I help create and maintain software that quickly brings huge amounts of data to people in an easy, intuitive, and digestable way. [**Model Match**](https://modelmatch.com) is a CRM for recruiters in the morgage industry :house:. 

I am also currently a Web Developement Teaching Asssitant at [UC Irivne, Division of Continuing Education](https://uci.edu). Zot, zot ðŸ’™ðŸ’›. This program, along with others, helped me to become a better developer and a better person. I'm really excited to pay it forward :pray:.
