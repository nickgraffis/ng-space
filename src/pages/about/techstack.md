# My Stack

## TypeScript/JavaScript
I curretly am working a lot with Javascript. I work on projects using Angular, React, Vue, and Svelte. They are all pretty awesome and I'm not sure what I like best. Within this I work with a ton of great libraries and tools including, WebPack, Vite, RxJs, Apollo, React-Query, and more. 
## Node - Server Side
On the server-side I work a lot in Node - _although i'm super pumped to try Deno_. I also work with some great tools such as GraphQL, Netlify, AWS, Express. I've been really taking a deep dive into Server Side Rendering and Generation as well.

## Database
I used MySQL, SQlite, PostgresQL early on in my adventures, but have since seen more advantages and a more enjoyable experiences with NoSQL, and specifically FaunaDB, DynamoDB (Elastic Search), and MangoDB.
## Python, PHP, C & Golang
Some things I have less experience in are Python, PHP, C, and Golang, although I have worked with both and some great tools for using these languages on the web. Flask and Laravel to be specific. 

In Python I have also been going through the CS50 AI course, and loving playing with the incredible things computers can do. 

In C and Go I have worked on bundle and build projects, as-well-as some great simple projects as I've been learning the advantages and disadvantages of both.
