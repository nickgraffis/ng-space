title: My Uses
---

## Workstation set up
* Macbook Pro 16in - I actually just had my laptop stolen in January of 2021, so my new laptop is a replacement of that and I love it.
* 2 LG 27in Monitors
* Apple Keyboard
* Magic Mouse 2
* Magic Trackpad
* Amazon Basics Sit/Stand Desk
## Development
* VS Code - I jumped between Sublime and Atom for a long time, then got bullied by some friends into VS Code. It works fast, doesn't crash, and has a ton of great features out of the box. It's awesome.
* Dracula Theme - Duh...
* iTerm/Zsh - Although VS Code has a good zsh in the code editor, I like having my terminal in it's own window. This has Dracula Theme as well.
* Insomnia - Agian, VS Code can do this for you, but Insomnia has some cool features like saving different environments and credintials.
## Design
## Hosting
## Office Space
* I spent a couple months in the summer of 2020 building my own office from an old tool shed in my backyard. It turned out great!
    1. Reframed the old toolshed door area and installed a Pella sliding glass door.
    2. Added cotton/denium insulation across all the walls.
    3. Wired the place up with 4 outlets and 2 sections of overhead lighting.
    4. Threw up some drywall and gave it a nice paint job.
