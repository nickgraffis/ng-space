I am a full time software engineer from Long Beach, Calif. Currently working remotly from San Fransisco, San Diego, and Los Angeles.

I work at [**Model Match**](https://modelmatch.com) where I help create and maintain software that quickly brings huge amounts of data to people in an easy, intuitive, and digestable way. At [**Model Match**](https://modelmatch.com), I'm really passionate about making things run _faster_ and improving workflow for myself and my team ‚ö°Ô∏è. I love problem solving and working with other to find optimal solutions. I'm lucky I get to do that every day. üòâ

In addition to my full time job, I am working on a ton of cool stuff with [**Bavel**](https://github.com/BAVEL-Technology), a group of collegues trying to dream up new tools that help other developers and the community as a whole.

Outside of prgramming I love surfing, food, wine, [water polo](/about/waterpolo), family, friends, and of course, Wesley.
