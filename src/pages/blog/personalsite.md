Hey! My goal in creating my personal website was to provide a great, real world excersise for me to learn about some awesome technologies, and to provide a canvas for me to showcase a little about me and my thoughts.

## First, the results

I really took care to make sure that I was creating something that left no stone unturned. I wanted a fast site, that did what it set out to do, well. _**There is always room for improvement, let me know if there is something off!**_.
