# NickGraffis.Space

Hey! My goal in creating my personal website was to provide a great, real world excersise for me to learn about some awesome technologies, and to provide a canvas for me to showcase a little about me and my thoughts.

## So for the first part, the techside.
This site is built with Vite, Vue, and Vite SSG. It's deployed on Netlify.
